# Easyidea

This project was created to simplify the creation of several designs to put on t-shirts, mugs, etc.

## Description

Every design that can be put on a print-on-demand site requires a long creation process such as finding the right fonts, images and colors. The purpose of this program is to automate most of this process by reducing the work to only giving the right images and quotes. After that, this program creates several designs that can be chosen to keep only the good one.

## Exemple

This program generates, for example, this type of design (in white and black version) :

![White design](./images/output/web-programmer-1-white.png)
